        I have upon graduation quickly learned that it is not solely about your
        grades in the job market. By gaining additional digital skills, I can
        leverage my skills in getting a good job at the very least but do you
        know what will sbsolutely make me happy? A remote job that will pay me
        enough to set up a new life in a small city. Right now, I have not
        decided on the city I would like to live in but my options are: The
        University towns- Ibadan and Nsukka. Ibadan for its proximity to Lagos
        and Nsukka for the nostalgia as it where I took my first degree. Also
        staying in these cities is a top choice for me as they house 2 of the
        top universities and this will be helpful if I feel like the timing is
        right to get my second degree. Ibadan is in the lead cause in addition,
        they have a program in Immunology and it is one train awway from Lagos
        where my family home is.
